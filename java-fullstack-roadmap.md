    comment: It is a great course teaching the fundamentals of Spring Boot and Angular. Integrating the Spring Boot with Angular using Restful services. Finally the author taught important aspects in the Spring Boot with an example. He also taught the JPA and how JPA is used to commit the data and retrieve the data using repository.

    comment: This Angular and Spring is an excellent course. This is better course than best rated 37Hr Angular course. Short and concise and no nonsense. Ranga is a very good teacher and talks to the point. Glad I took this course. Learned a lot. Thank you Ranga.
